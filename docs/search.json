Professionally, I’m interested in the role of data and technology in supporting decision-making, improving marine conservation, and enhancing sustainable and equitable fisheries.\nAs a person, I love adventuring outside, sunset surfs, and I used to work as a PADI Divemaster in Thailand and the Bahamas. You can find me wherever there’s big trees, wildflowers, small waves, or a taco shop 🌲 🌻 🌊 🌮\nPoke around my website to learn more!"
