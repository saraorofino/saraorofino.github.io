### welcome

My name is Sara and I work as an ocean scientist at The Nature Conservancy (TNC) in California. Professionally, my work focuses on using remote sensing and near-real time data analytics to support decision-making and unlock new opportunities for policy, research, and action.

As a person, I love reading, getting outside, sunset surfs, and I used to work as a PADI Divemaster in Thailand and the Bahamas. You can find me wherever there's big trees, wildflowers, small waves, or a taco shop ðŸŒ² ðŸŒ» ðŸŒŠ ðŸŒ®

Poke around my website to learn more!
