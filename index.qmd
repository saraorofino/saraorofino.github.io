### welcome

My name is Sara and I work as a project scientist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Professionally, I'm interested in the role of data and technology in supporting decision-making, improving marine conservation, and enhancing sustainable and equitable fisheries.

As a person, I love adventuring outside, sunset surfs, and I used to work as a PADI Divemaster in Thailand and the Bahamas. You can find me wherever there's big trees, wildflowers, small waves, or a taco shop ðŸŒ² ðŸŒ» ðŸŒŠ ðŸŒ®

Poke around my website to learn more!
