### **research**

I work as a project scientist at the [Environmental Markets Lab](https://emlab.ucsb.edu/) at University of California, Santa Barbara. My current research includes:

-   üî≠ Investigating how big data can support sustainable fisheries by leveraging satellite-based vessel tracking (i.e. Automatic Identification Systems), Electronic Monitoring, and Synthetic Aperature Radar in research related to bycatch mitigation, fisheries transparency, and protected area design.

    -   Check out [emLab's GitHub](https://github.com/emlab-ucsb) for repositories related to our published research.

-   üó∫Ô∏è Mapping global patterns of shark mortality and analyzing the effectiveness of shark fishing and finning regulations on mortality.

-   üñ•Ô∏è co-developing `stagg::` a data pre-processing R package for climate impact analysis.

### leisure

In my free time I enjoy exploring with friends from hiking local trails, to finding secret waves, getting lost in the forest and everything in between. I love the first sun of spring and feeling the warmth sink all the way to my bones, the sound rocks make as the ocean waves recede, and the smell of a Redwood forest.
