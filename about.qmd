### **research**

I work as an ocean scientist on the California Oceans Program at [The Nature Conservancy](https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/where-we-work/united-states/california/). I provide scientific leadership and technical expertise across the program ensuring our strategies are data-driven and grounded in the best available science. Much of my work focuses on using remote sensing and near-real time data analytics to unlock conservation opportunities including addressing statewide plastic pollution, accelerating the pace and scale of ecosystem restoration, and addressing unsustainable bycatch in Pacific fisheries.

### leisure

In my free time I enjoy exploring with friends from hiking local trails, to finding secret waves, getting lost in the forest and everything in between. I love the first sun of spring and feeling the warmth sink all the way to my bones, the sound rocks make as the ocean waves recede, and the smell of a Redwood forest.
